# Implement a simple depth-first survey strategy that expands out from
# DEC=18deg (2deg) in the NGC (SGC), with all tiles included in the
# schedule as soon as they have fibers assigned.

NLO:
    # Expand downwards from DEC=18deg in all passes.
    cap: N
    passes: 5
    dec_max: 18
    dec_order: -0.2
    rules:
        NLO(5): { START: 1.0 }

SLO:
    # Expand upwards from DEC=2deg in all passes.
    cap: S
    passes: 5
    dec_max: 2
    dec_order: -0.2
    rules:
        SLO(5): { START: 1.0 }
